# Telco-Customer-Churn
## Background ##
After the interruption of Fido few months ago, I noticed that there are a lot of people talk about choosing another telco with better and more stable service. So I began to think about the churn of Telco Customer.

Especially nowadays, the telecom market is gradually becoming saturated, everyone has at least one telecom account. For the development of the telecom industry, the user retention rate is particularly important. 

## Data Resource ##
The data for this case comes from the modeling dataset which is shared on Kaggle: Telco Customer Churn. in the dataset, there are more than 7000 rows and 21 columns, each row represents a customer, each column contains customerâ€™s attributes, such as their age, gender, whether they have phone service or multiple lines, etc.

## Target ##
- Analyze the relationship between user characteristics and churn.
- From the overall situation, what are the common characteristics of lost users?
- Provide targeted suggestions to increase user stickiness and prevent loss.
